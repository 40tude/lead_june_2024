# Notes and projects source code from my "Data Science & Engineering - Lead" training at JEDHA

* JEDHA Bootcamp's **Lead** training course leads to official professional certification ([RNCP 38_777](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/38777/)): “Artificial intelligence architect”.
* The **Lead** training comes after the **Fullstack** training (JEDHA)
    * My Notes and Projects of the **Fullstack** training are available [here](https://github.com/40tude/fullstack_mars_2024_3) 
* 3 weeks
* june 24 - july 12 2024
